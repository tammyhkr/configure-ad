- Step 6: Setup Remote Deskstop for non-administrative users on Client-1
- Step 7: Create a bunch of additional user to attempt to log into Client-1 with one of the users

<h2>Deployment and Configuration Steps</h2>

1. Setup Resources in Azure
   - Create virtual machines in Azure (Note: when you create the virtual machine, it will automatically create a resouce group and virtual network for you)
   - Create the Domain Controller VM and name it 'DC-1' 
       - Name your resource group 'AD-Lab' by selecting 'Create New' and select 'Ok'
       - Enter DC-1 in the 'Virtual machine name' field
       - Select US West 2 or 3 region (whichever works for you)
       - Ensure the 'Availability options' field is 'No infrastructure redundancy required'
       - Ensure the 'Security type' field is 'Standard'
       - Select Windows Server 2022 in the 'Image' field
       - Select at least 2 vcpus for the 'Size' field
       - Create your own user name and password
       - Select 'Review + create -> then Create
         
   - Create the Client-1 VM and name it 'Client-1'
       - Select 'AD-Lab' as the resource group
       - Enter Client-1 in the 'Virtual machine name' field
       - Select US West 2 or 3 region (whichever works for you)
       - Ensure the 'Availability options' field is 'No infrastructure redundancy required'
       - Ensure the 'Security type' field is 'Standard'
       - Select Windows 10 Pro in the 'Image' field
       - Select at least 2 vcpus for the 'Size' field
       - Create your own user name and password
       - Check the 'Licensing' box
       - Click 'Next' to get to the 'Networking tab'
       - Select the same Virtual network as the DC-1 VM (Note: if you do not do this step, you will not be able to connect to the Domain Controller)

          *Note: Give DC-1 at least 10 minutes to completely deploy in order to select same virtual network
       - Select 'Review + create -> then Create

2. Ensure Connectivity between the Client and Domain Controller

 - Log into Client-1 and ping DC-1's IP address with 'ping -t' (perpetual ping)
    - Connect and log in with credentials created in Azure
    - Copy the Domain Controllers Private IP Address -> Azure -> Virtual Machines -> DC-1 -> scroll until you see 'Networking' -> copy the Private IP Address
    - Go to 'Start' and open the 'Command Prompt' app
    - Ping the DC's Private IP address
    - You'll notice the request will time out due to DC-1's Windows Firewall blocking ICMPv4 traffic
 - Minimize Client-1 VM and log into the Domain Controller (DC-1) via Remote Desktop Connection and enable ICMPv4 on the local Windows Firewall
    - Click start and open up 'Server Manager' if it has not opened automatically after logging in
    - Click start to open up the Windows Firewall
        - Click Inbound rules (maximize the Firewall)
        - Click 'Protocol'
        - Enable ICMPv4 (select line, right click -> enable)
        - Minimize DC-1
    - Check back at Client-1 to see ping succeed a.k. 'Reply'
        -Stop the ping by hitting 'ctrl +c' on your keyboard

3. Install Active Directory

   - Go to DC-1 VM
   - Open Sever Manager (if it is not already open, click the start menu and select 'Sever Manager')
   - Once Sever Manager is open, click 'Add roles and features
   - Click 'Next' until you reach 'Sever Roles'-> select 'Active Directory Domain Services' -> you'll get a pop up to 'Add Features' (click that)
   - Click 'Next' through all of the dependencides and select Install -> Click 'Close' once the install finishes
   - After the intall, go back to Server Manager and click on the yellow caution icon -> click on 'Promote this sever to a doman controller'
   - Once 'Deployment Configuration' opens click on 'Add new forest' -> name the domain in the 'Root domain name' field (create any name) -> click 'Next' -> create your own password -> click 'Next' until you reach 'Install'
   - After the installation you'll automactically be kicked out of DC-1 VM
   - Log back into DC-1 VM using your original credentials + Root Domain Name created when installing AD (Reason being is, we have now turned this VM into a Domain Controller)

4. Create an Admin and Normal User Account in AD

   - Once logged back into DC-1 VM, open Active Directory
       - Go to tools within 'Server Manager' -> click Active Directory Users and Computers
       - Create a couple of Organizational Units (OU) [think of them like folders]
          - Right click 'mydomain.com' -> go to 'New' -> click 'Organizational Unit'
          - In the 'Name' field, enter _EMPLOYEES -> click 'Ok'
          - Repeat steps and name another Organizational Unit _ADMINS
   - Right click 'mydomain.com' and click refresh to view the OU's created
   - Create an administrative account
       - Go to '_ADMINS' and right click -> go to 'New' -> select 'User'
       - Create your own credentials -> click 'Next' -> create your own password -> uncheck the box that says 'User must change password at next logon' -> click 'Next' and then 'Finish'
       -  After the user is created, right click the user's name -> go to 'Properties' -> click the 'Member of' tab -> click 'Add' -> enter 'domain' in the emtpy field -> click 'Check Names' -> join the 'Domain Admins' group -> click 'Ok' and apply
          
         
   - Log off of DC-1 VM and log back in using the admin credentials we just created
     - Go to start and open the 'Command Promt' app -> type 'logoff'
     - Log back in using admin credentials
     - Click start and open the 'Command Promt' app -> type 'whoami' and you'll see you're now logged in as jane_admin in DC-1 VM

5. Join Clien-1 to your domain (mydomain.com)
   
  - From the Azure Portal, set Client-1's VM DNS settings to the DC's Private IP address
     - Get DC-1 Private IP Address in Azure
     - Go to Azure -> Virtual Machines -> Client-1 -> click on Network -> click on Network settings -> click on the blue hyperlink under NIC that says 'client-1852' -> go to 'DNS Servers' -> select 'custom' -> enter DC-1's Private IP Address in the 'DNS Server' field -> click 'Save'
  - Restart Client-1 VM in Azure
     - Go to Virtual Machines -> Client-1 -> click 'Restart'
  - Log into Client-1 as the original local admin and join it to the domain (computer will restart)
     - Once logged in, right click the start menu -> go to System -> click 'Rename this PC (advancded) on the right -> click 'Change' -> select 'Domain' -> enter your Domain Name -> click 'Ok' -> enter the admins credentials 'mydomain.com\jane_admin' -> click 'Ok' -> a window will pop up asking to restart the computer, click 'Restart now' (if not, go to the start menu and click 'Restart' to force it, log back into Client-1 VM w/ the admin credentials)
  - You have now joined Client-1 to the Domain successfully

7. Create a bunch of additional users and attempt to log into Client-1 with on of the users

  - Open up DC-1 and log in as 'mydomain.com\jane_admin'
  - Click the start menu and open 'Windows Powershell ISE' (right click to 'Run as administrator') -. click 'Yes' for the pop up
  - Click on the blank paper icon to create a new file
  - Paste your script under the 'Untitled' tab
  - Run the script by click the green play icon at the top
  - You'll start to see random user names being created
  - Minimize Powershell
  - Go back into Active Directory -> click on 'mydomain.com' -> click '_EMPLOYEES' -> you should see all the users that) are being created from PowerShell ISE in this folder (if you do not see them, right click '_EMPLOYEES' and click 'Refresh')
  - Double click on a random user name from the '_EMPLOYEES' folder (pick an easy username)
  - Copy the 'Display name' aka the 'Account Name'
  - Minimize DC-1
  - Log out of Client-1 and log back in with the users credentials we copied (in this case: 'mydomain.com\ban.jot)
      *Note: The password for all these users is 'Password1' per the script we pasted into PowerShell ISE
  - Open the command line and type 'whoami' to view user name -> type 'hostname' to view the host you're logged into
