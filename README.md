<h1>Active Directory Deployed in the Cloud (Azure)</h1>
This tutorial outlines the implementation of on-premises Active Directory within Azure Virtual Machines.<br />



<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Active Directory Domain Services
- PowerShell

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows Server 2022
- Windows 10 (21H2)

<h2>High-Level Deployment and Configuration Steps</h2>

- Step 1: Setup Resources in Azure
- Step 2: Ensure Connectivity between the Client and Domain Controller
- Step 3: Install Active Directory
- Step 4: Create an Admin and Normal User Account in Active Directory
- Step 5: Join Clien-1 to your domain (mydomain.com)
- Step 6: Setup Remote Deskstop for non-administrative users on Client-1
- Step 7: Create a bunch of additional user to attempt to log into Client-1 with one of the users

<h2>Deployment and Configuration Steps</h2>

1. Setup Resources in Azure
   - Create virtual machines in Azure (Note: when you create the virtual machine, it will automatically create a resouce group and virtual network for you)
   - Create the Domain Controller VM and name it 'DC-1' 
       - Name your resource group 'AD-Lab' by selecting 'Create New' and select 'Ok'
       - Enter DC-1 in the 'Virtual machine name' field
       - Select US West 2 or 3 region (whichever works for you)
       - Ensure the 'Availability options' field is 'No infrastructure redundancy required'
       - Ensure the 'Security type' field is 'Standard'
       - Select Windows Server 2022 in the 'Image' field
       - Select at least 2 vcpus for the 'Size' field
       - Create your own user name and password
       - Select 'Review + create -> then Create
         
   - Create the Client-1 VM and name it 'Client-1'
       - Select 'AD-Lab' as the resource group
       - Enter Client-1 in the 'Virtual machine name' field
       - Select US West 2 or 3 region (whichever works for you)
       - Ensure the 'Availability options' field is 'No infrastructure redundancy required'
       - Ensure the 'Security type' field is 'Standard'
       - Select Windows 10 Pro in the 'Image' field
       - Select at least 2 vcpus for the 'Size' field
       - Create your own user name and password
       - Check the 'Licensing' box
       - Click 'Next' to get to the 'Networking tab'
       - Select the same Virtual network as the DC-1 VM (Note: if you do not so this step, you will not be able to connect to the Domain Controller)
           *Note: Give DC-1 at least 10 minutes to completely deploy in order to select same virtual network
       - Select 'Review + create -> then Create

  - Set Domain Controllerâ€™s NIC Private IP address to be static
    - Go to Virtual Machines
    - Select DC-1
    - Select 'Networking' -> 'Network Settings'
    - Click on the 'Network Interface' (NIC) hyperlink
    - Click 'IP Configurations'
    - Click the 'ipconfig1' hyperlink to change the Private IP Address from 'Dynamic' to 'Static'
    - Select 'Static' and Save

2. Ensure Connectivity between the Client and Domain Controller

 - Log into Client-1 and ping DC-1's IP address with 'ping -t' (perpetual ping)
    - Connect and log in with credentials created in Azure
    - Copy the Domain Controllers Private IP Address -> Azure -> Virtual Machines -> DC-1 -> scroll until you see 'Networking' -> copy the Private IP Address
    - Go to 'Start' and open the 'Command Prompt' app
    - Ping the DC's Private IP address
    - You'll notice the request will time out due to DC-1's Windows Firewall blocking ICMPv4 traffic
 - Minimize Client-1 VM and log into the Domain Controller (DC-1) via Remote Desktop Connection and enable ICMPv4 on the local Windows Firewall
    - Click start and open up 'Server Manager' if it has not opened automatically after logging in
    - Click start to open up the Windows Firewall
        - Click Inbound rules (maximize the Firewall)
        - Click 'Protocol'
        - Enable ICMPv4 (select line, right click -> enable)
        - Minimize DC-1
    - Check back at Client-1 to see ping succeed a.k. 'Reply'
        -Stop the ping by hitting 'ctrl +c' on your keyboard
